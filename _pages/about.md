I am a final-year PhD candidate at Politecnico di Milano (PoliMI), Italy under under supervision of Prof. [Massimo Tornatore](https://tornatore.faculty.polimi.it/). I received my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China. Additionally, I earned a double master's degree from SJTU and PoliMI, obtaining a master's degree in Telecommunications from SJTU and a master's degree in Computer Science from PoliMI. I also worked with Dr. [Patricia Layec](https://www.nokia.com/blog/author/patricia-layec/) in Nokia Bell Labs France as a assitant optical networking research in 2023.
